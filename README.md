# Optimizing-the-Marketing-Campaign

A "XYZ" organization seeks to better target its solicitations for donation. By only soliciting the most likely donors, less money will be spent on solicitation efforts and more money will be available for charitable concerns. Solicitations involve sending a small gift to an individual and include a request for a donation. Gifts to donors include mailing labels and greeting cards.
The organization has more than 3.5 million individuals in its mailing database.
These individuals are classified by their response behaviours to previous solicitation efforts. Of particular interest is the class of individuals identified as lapsing donors.
These individuals made their most recent donation between 12 and 24 months ago.
The organization seeks to rank its lapsing donors based on their responses to a greeting card mailing sent in June of 1997. (The charity calls this the 97NK Campaign.) With this ranking a decision can be made to either solicit or ignore a lapsing individual in the June 1998 campaign.
The target B is the outcome variable with two categories (1 being who actually donated and 0 being the one who did not donate it).Target D is the amount given and at this point of time the business wants to ignore it.
